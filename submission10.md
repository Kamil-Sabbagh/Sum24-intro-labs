# Cloud Computing Lab - Artifact Registries and Serverless Computing Platforms

## Introduction
In this lab assignment, we research and compare artifact registries and serverless computing platforms in AWS, GCP, and Azure. The findings are documented in this Markdown file, providing information on popular artifact registries and the best serverless computing platforms in each cloud platform.

## Task 1: Artifact Registries Research
### Objective
Identify and document the most popular artifact registries in AWS, GCP, and Azure.

### AWS Artifact Registries
#### Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR)
- **Key Features:**
  - Fully managed Docker container registry
  - Integrated with Amazon ECS and Kubernetes
  - Supports image scanning for vulnerabilities
  - High availability and scalability
  - Lifecycle policies for automated cleanup

### GCP Artifact Registries
#### Google Artifact Registry
- **Key Features:**
  - Unified repository for container images and language packages
  - Integrated with Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)
  - Supports multiple artifact formats including Docker, npm, Maven, and more
  - Fine-grained access control and security
  - Cross-region replication for availability

### Azure Artifact Registries
#### Azure Container Registry (ACR)
- **Key Features:**
  - Managed Docker registry service
  - Geo-replication for high availability
  - Integrated with Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)
  - Supports OCI artifacts
  - Built-in tasks for automated image builds and base image updates

## Task 2: Serverless Computing Platform Research
### Objective
Identify and document the best serverless computing platforms in AWS, GCP, and Azure.

### AWS Serverless Computing Platforms
#### AWS Lambda
- **Key Features:**
  - Fully managed compute service
  - Automatically scales based on demand
  - Supports multiple programming languages
  - Integrated with AWS services (e.g., S3, DynamoDB, API Gateway)
  - Pay only for compute time used

### GCP Serverless Computing Platforms
#### Google Cloud Functions
- **Key Features:**
  - Event-driven serverless compute platform
  - Supports multiple programming languages
  - Integrated with Google Cloud services (e.g., Pub/Sub, Cloud Storage, Firestore)
  - Automatic scaling and load balancing
  - Pay-per-use pricing model

### Azure Serverless Computing Platforms
#### Azure Functions
- **Key Features:**
  - Event-driven compute experience
  - Supports a variety of programming languages
  - Integrated with Azure services (e.g., Event Grid, Service Bus, Cosmos DB)
  - Scales automatically based on demand
  - Consumption-based pricing model

## Conclusion
This document provides an overview of the most popular artifact registries and the best serverless computing platforms available in AWS, GCP, and Azure. Each service offers unique features and benefits, making them suitable for different use cases and application requirements.
